		<div class="translucent-box">
			<p>The Baltimore Whiskey Company is humbly owned and operated by Max Lents, Jake Holshue, and Ian Newton. Each of us is a proud resident of Baltimore, The Greatest City in America. We are inspired by the city’s pride in its history, music, sports, cuisine, arts, and humanity to bring a culture of Rye whiskey manufacturing back to Maryland.</p>
			<p>We are proud to be a part of the buzzing, vibrant community that boasts of America’s first cathedral, a world-renowned medical school in Johns Hopkins, Hampden’s annual toilet races, multiple NFL Superbowl championships, and one of the nation’s most eclectic, community-supported art scenes. Such a city deserves a spirit to be proud of. Cheers, hon.</p>

		<div class="translucent-box">
			<p>We are stoked on Baltimore. Frank Zappa, Upton Sinclair, The Ripkens, Poe, Frederick Douglass, and Billie Holiday were born here. We had a subjectively great Grand Prix for a couple of years, and people come from literally dozens of miles for street festivals such as Artscape, Soundscape, Hampdenfest, Ratscape, Scape Scape. Charm City is also enjoying an acceleration of its craft culture – radical bookstores/coffee roasters, farm-to-table restaurants, awesome hipster bike stores, and craft breweries dot the city in growing numbers. These artists are not only pushing the envelopes of their craft niches but also hanging onto the good parts of tradition in each respective industry.It’s a great balance of youthful passion and time-tested tradition. The Baltimore Whiskey Company looks to push Baltimore into the growing world of craft spirits by bringing its bold spirits to the city.</p>

		<h1 class="about-us-2-h1">Maryland Rye</h1>
		<div class="translucent-box">
			<p>Maryland Rye was such a big thing that, even though the state has not appreciably produced any in some decades, Maryland Rye is still a big thing. As a grain and a spirit, rye predates these United States, and it is easy to see historical figures such as George Washington himself growing a crop of rye and distilling the spirit a few hundred years ago. Compared to the corn-mash bourbons of Kentucky which contain between zero and 49% rye by volume of the mash, a proper straight rye whiskey will have a good deal of spice, dryness, and complexity as distinguishing characteristics that make the beverage a decidedly sophisticated spirit. Maryland has not forgotten how to enjoy a good rye whiskey, so we intend to see that she does not forget how to manufacture it either.</p>
